## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a Simple Pictures-Match game Android app using Java. This app offers users the choice to play as a guest or create a simple account with a login and password.

## Features:
- Playing as Geust or with Account Creation.
- Guest Mode: In the guest mode, users can access five levels of the game. Each level has a time limit for completion, and if the time runs out, the user loses. However, the game allows the user to start a new game within the same level until they win and progress to the next level.
- Account Creation: Users also have the option to create an account. Account holders also have access to five levels of the game, but with added customization options. They can choose the subject of the pictures they match, such as Cats, Dogs, Birds, or Trees.
- Profile Management: Account holders can update their profiles, including their name, login, and password. This feature ensures that users can personalize their gaming experience and maintain account security.
- Score Sharing: Users with accounts share a scoring system. Each user can view their accumulated points and compare their level and scores with other users. This feature promotes competition and community engagement among players.
- Sound effects and music.
